Transit SBus Interface</A></H2>

<P>Our initial SBus interface was base on the MIT-brewed <A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/transit/tn67/tn67.html">Transit
SBus Interface:</A></P>

<P>&quot;This note describes a simple SBus interface designed for providing
interfacing from an SBus based machine ( e.g. Sparcstations) to various
custom hardware. This interface was designed primarily for communication
with boundary-scan controllers and Transit nodes (<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/transit/tn38/tn38.html">tn38</A>).
Nevertheless, it uses a minimal asynchronous interface making it suitable
for providing simple interfacing to many devices. The over-riding goals
in this SBus interface implementation were to keep the design simple and
build it quickly. The interface is an SBus slave card which supports only
single-word read and write operations. The interface card itself includes
a boundary-scan controller which supports two independent boundary scan
paths. &quot;</P>

<P>We implemented an interface between an &quot;Argus&quot; version of
the IKOS VirtuaLogic Emulator and a Transit Sbus card, providing a 24 bit
address, 32 bit data connection that was directly read and written via
memory-mapped on a host SPARC10 workstation. We successfully operated the
interface in the 100KHz to 1MHz range for certain designs.</P>

<P>We abandon this interface when upgrading to a &quot;Hermes&quot; version
VirtuaLogic emulator in favor of the commercially available <A HREF="../slic/README.html">SLIC
EB-1 Sbus interface</A>.</P>
