<H4>Introduction from SLIC documentation:</H4>

<P><B>&quot;Dawn VME Products' </B>SLIC EB-1 is a kit for prototyping hardware
and software which provides a total solution for developing new SBus applications
or porting existing applications from a different bus architecture. The
kit centers around the Motoral MC92005 (a.k.a. SLIC) which is a complete
SBus slave interface in a single chip.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The MC92005's PBus is an asnychronous programmable private bus,
whose signals and timing can be dynamically redefined, allowing it to interface
to a wide variety of commercially-available peripheral chips.&quot;</P>

<P><B>MIT-RAW setup:</B></P>

<P>The external I/Os of an IKOS &quot;Hermes&quot; VirtuaLogic Emulation
System are connected to the PBus interface of a SLIC card located in the
host SPARC workstation. This directory contains the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="driver/README.html">Software driver</A> code in a sub-directory.
</LI>

<LI>Verilog code (<A HREF="interface.v">interface.v </A><A HREF="system.v">system.v)</A>
which implements the VLE side of the interface</LI>

<LI>Synopsys scripts (<A HREF="interface.syn">interface.syn</A> <A HREF="system.syn">system.syn</A>)
to synthesis this code into an IKOS-supplied target library</LI>

<LI><A HREF="vmw.clk">Clock</A> and <A HREF="vmw.pod">pod</A> files that
describe the current configuration in our lab</LI>
</UL>

<P>The current interface is somewhat conservative in communicating between
the synchronous clocking of the VLE system and the asynchronous PBus. Without
taking advantage of any knowledge of the internal operations of the virtualization
and high speed &quot;virtual wires&quot; clock in the VLE, and while sticking
to a single edge clocking scheme, the interface has 2 cycle reads and writes</P>

<P>Because of its simplicity, the interface itself typical creates a critical
path within the emulator of only 8 virtual cycles, so we do not expect
it to be on the critical path of large designs.</P>
