This code is copied from the source code for the SLIC interface card and
modified as follows:

sliceb_drv.c: modified to support memory mapping the entire interface,
not just the registers, see function yy_map.

poke.c: modified to poke directly into port1 address space instead
        of the eeprom starting point (by offset everything 0x20000.

interface.c, interface.h: new code to be used as the VLE driver library.
