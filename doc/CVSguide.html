<HR SIZE=3>This guide describes the common CVS command set needed to proficiently
contribute to RAW Benchmark development. For a more comprehensive description,

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_85.html#SEC87">structure

<UL>
<UL>
<LI><TT>cvs [cvs-options] command [command-options] [files...]</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>To get help use the -H flag with CVS or with a particular command:</P>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI><TT>cvs -H</TT></LI>

<LI><TT>cvs checkout -H</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="Basic command set"></A>3. Basic Command Set</P>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_26.html#SEC28">cvs
login</A></DT>

<DL COMPACT>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Do this first if you are running a CVS client on a remote machine.</DT>

<DT>You will be prompted for you cvs password. See this <A HREF="#Client/Server Notes">note</A>
if you have problems.</DT>
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_92.html#SEC96">cvs
checkout</A></DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT>Next, change to your working directory (for example: <TT>cd ~/sandbox</TT>)
and checkout a local copy of the module you want to work on. The main benchmark
module is named <TT>benchmark</TT>. A new directory will be created called
benchmark. If you want, you can just checkout a particular directory or
file as well:</DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Checkout benchmark main trunk: <TT>cvs checkout benchmark</TT></LI>

<LI>Checkout benchmark/src directory: <TT>cvs checkout benchmark/suites</TT></LI>

<LI>Checkout benchmark/src/worcom.for file: <TT>cvs checkout benchmark/doc/CVSguide.html</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<DT>Generally, you should always checkout out the entire version as you
will be expected to compile and test any changes before recommiting later.</DT>

<DT>Checkout can also be used with the <TT>-r</TT> flag to checkout a particulare
revision or branch:</DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Checkout v02 revision: <TT>cvs checkout -r v02 benchmark</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>Note that revisions are immutable, so they can never be changed and
re-commited. Only the main trunk and branches can be commited back later.
The <TT>-r</TT> flag refers to a tagged version which you are checking
out. For each file in the repository you will get the RCS version of that
file which matches that tag rather than the &quot;head&quot;, or latest
version. Thus a tag defines a cross-section of RCS file revisions. (Note:
RCS is the file-by-file version control system that CVS is built upon).</P>
</UL>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_125.html#SEC132">cvs
update</A></DT>

<DL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<DT>If other developers commit changes to the branch (or main trunk) you
have checked out, you will need to update before you can commit your changes.
Or you may just want to update your local version to reflect the latest
changes on your current branch.</DT>

<P>To update your copy of a module with any changes from the central repository
execute:</P>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>cvs update</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>This will tell you which files have been updated (their names are displayed
with a U before them), and which have been modified by you and not yet
committed (preceded by an M).Here is a full list of <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_127.html#SEC134">update
outputs</A> from reference manual.</P>

<P>It can be that when you do an update, the changes in the central copy
clash with changes you have made in your own copy. You will be warned of
any files that contain clashes by a preceding C. Inside the files the clashes
will be marked in the file surrounded by lines of the form <TT>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</TT>
and <TT>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</TT>. You have to resolve the clashes in your
copy by hand. After an update where there have been clashes, your original
version of the file is saved as <TT>`.#file.version'</TT>. </P>

<P>If you feel you have messed up a file and wish to have CVS forget about
your changes and go back to the version from the repository, delete the
file and do an <TT>cvs update</TT>. CVS will announce that the file has
been &quot;lost&quot; and will give you a fresh copy.</P>

<P>To display all files which are not up-to-date without actually changing
anything in your working directory:</P>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>cvs -n -q update</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>You can use the -r flag with <TT>cvs update</TT> as well, with the following
possibilities:</P>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Update local version to revision 01:<TT> cvs update -r v01</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>If your local version is up-to-date with respect to your base version
(as determined by your <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_52.html#SEC54">sticky
tag</A>), i.e. there are no file that need to be commited since your last
checkout or update, update -r simply change your local version to reflect
the repository, as-if you had checked-out that version from scratch. However,
if you have changes, then update merges the differences between your changes
and the base version with the -r version files into your local repository
(see the manual if my explanation is unclear here!).</P>
</UL>
</DL>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_95.html#SEC99">cvs
commit</A></DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT>When you think your files are ready to be merged back into the repository
for the rest of your developers to see, execute <TT>cvs commit</TT>. You
will be put in an editor to make a message that describes the changes that
you have made (for future reference). Your changes will then be added to
the central copy. To add the comment without needing the editor, use:</DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>cvs commit -m &quot;Comment for log file.&quot;</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>When you do a commit, if you haven't updated to the most recent version
of the files, CVS tells you this. You will have to first update, resolve
any possible clashes, and then redo the commit.</P>

<P>You should not commit changes until they are ready for consumption by
other developers. At minimum you should compile you changes and verify
that at least a minimum level of tests (say, the acid tests) pass.</P>
</UL>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_59.html#SEC61">cvs
add</A> and <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_60.html#SEC62">cvs
remove </A></DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT>It can be that the changes you want to make involve a completely new
file (or directory), or removing an existing one. The commands to use here
are:</DT>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>cvs add filename</TT></LI>

<LI><TT>cvs remove filename</TT></LI>
</UL>

<DT>You have to do a commit after these commands to make the additions
and removes actually take affect. You may make any number of new files
in your copy of the repository, but they will not be committed to the central
copy unless you do a <TT>cvs add</TT>. </DT>

<DT>CVS remove does not actually remove the files from the repository.
It only removes them from the &quot;current list&quot; and puts the files
in the CVS Attic. When another person checks out the module in the future
they will not get the files that were removed. But if you ask for older
versions that had the file before it was removed, the file will be checked
out of the Attic.</DT>
</UL>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_115.html#SEC122">cvs
release </A></DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT>When you are done with your local copy of the files for the time being
and want to remove your local copy use <TT>cvs release directory. </TT>This
must be done in the directory above the module sub-directory you which
to release. It safely cancels the effects of <TT>cvs checkout</TT>. Usually
you should do a commit first. Examples:</DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Release benchmark directory: <TT>cvs release benchmark</TT></LI>

<LI>Release and delete benchmark directory: <TT>cvs release -d benchmark</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>NOTE: Take your time here. CVS will inform you of files that may have
changed or it does not know about (watch for the ? lines) and then with
ask you to confirm this action. Make sure you want to do this. </P>

<P>NOTE: With the way we are using CVS, releasing is not strictly necessary.
rm -r (or deletion via File Manager) is okay if you are sure you have successfully
commited your changes.</P>
</UL>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_98.html#SEC105">cvs

<DT>To find out information about your CVS repositories use the <TT>cvs
history</TT> command. By default history will show you all the entries
that correspond to you. Use the -a option to show information about everyone.
</DT>

<UL COMPACT>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_123.html#SEC130">cvs
tag </A></DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT>One of the exciting features of CVS is its ability to mark all the
files in a module at once with a symbolic name. You can say `this copy
of my files is version 3'. And then later say `this file I am working on
looked better in version 3 so check out the copy that I marked as version
3.' </DT>

<P>Use <TT>cvs tag</TT> to tag the version of the files that you have checked
out. You can then at a later date retrieve this version of the files with
the tag. </P>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>cvs tag jbabb-mytag</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>Later, you can do:</P>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>cvs checkout -r jbabb-mytag benchmark</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>A tag can be deleted with the <TT>-d</TT> option:</P>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>cvs tag -d jbabb-mytag</TT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>Generally, deleting tags may not be a good idea. Definitely do not delete
a branch tag. Of course benchmark versions (i.e. v02)&nbsp;should never
be deleted once they have been tagged correctly. Unless developers find
them personally useful, we should probably stay away from using a bunch
of random tags, and then stick to rtag for release management.</P>
</UL>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_119.html#SEC126">cvs
rtag</A></DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT>Like tag, rtag marks the current versions of files. The only difference
is that you don't need to have a checked out module to create the tag,
simply specify it as an argument. The is the heart of the RAW release command
and should probably only be used by the release engineer. Here are some
good examples taken from how I expect the release engineering to work:</DT>

<DT>To freeze current trunk development of benchmark and create Benchmark
Version 0.2 (note: the source files should ready for release, with the
inline version set, everything compilable and tested):</DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>cvs rtag v02 benchmark</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<DT>This will recursively go through all the repository directories in
benchmark and add the v02 tag to each file.</DT>
</UL>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_119.html#SEC126">cvs
import</A></DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<DT>This command is used to create a new module and import files to it.
Generally this is not all that needs to be done to create a new module,
however this example is for developers who want to create a test module
to play around with. First, create a directory and include the files (or
additional directories) that you want imported. From within the top directory
to be imported (not above it), do something like:</DT>

<UL COMPACT>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>cvs import -m &quot;Created demo module&quot; demo vendor vendor1</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>See that manual about vendor branches, for playing with a demo the names
are not important. The above command will create a module named demo and
import into it all the files and directories in the current directory.</P>
