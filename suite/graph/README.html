<P>The RAW benchmarks for single source shortest path (ssp), multiplicative
shortest path (spm) and transitive closure (tc) specialize both the algorithm
and the topology of the input graph. In each case we generate computation
elements for each node of the input graph and then use the RawCS generator
to connect these elements in the same topology as the problem input graph.
For the shortest path problems the computation element is a circuit that
finds the minimum of its inputs. For the transitive closure problem the
computation element is an AND function across its inputs. With the exception
of ssp64-mesh, each of the graph benchmark cases is randomly generated
with a maximum node in-degree of eight, and an average in-degree of four.

graph problems with dynamic computation structures</A>, by Jonathan Babb,
Matthew Frank, and Anant Agarwal. </P>
