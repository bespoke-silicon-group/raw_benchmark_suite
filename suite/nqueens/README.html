The N-Queens benchmark solves the combinatorially hard chess problem of
placing <I>N</I> queens on an <IMG WIDTH=47 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline75" SRC="../../doc/img7.gif"> chessboard such that no queen
can attack any other.  The typical software solution to this problem
uses a recursive search for a placement of the queens that meets the
correct conditions.  In the RAW benchmark the program is represented
by <I>N</I> computation elements, each of which is responsible for the
position of one of the queens.  A token is passed back and forth
between these computational elements representing control flow, much
as a stack pointer would in the recursive software solution to the
algorithm.  Each computational element monitors the positions of the
queens in other columns to determine a legal position for its own
queen.  During a particular cycle, only the computational element
currently holding the token changes the position of its queen.
